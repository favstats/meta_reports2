# Meta Ad Library Reports

This repository retrieves Meta Ad Library spending reports from [here](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/report/).

These spending reports really should be available via the Meta Ad Library API. For no good reason these spending reports (which include the exact spending amounts) are not provided for researchers, civil society, or anyone seeking to investigate digital political ads on Meta.

This repository changes that.
